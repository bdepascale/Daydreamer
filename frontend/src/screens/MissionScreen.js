          <h5>Here at Daydreamer, we focus on providing unique clothes while making strives to be sustainable and inclusive.</h5>
        </p>
        <h2>Unique</h2>
        <p>
          Given the nature of using sustainable fabric, it is hard to guarantee the exact same materials, therefore each piece we create is unique.
          This provides you with a piece that is one-of-a-kind just for you. We aim to create designs that inspire your creativity and help express
          your own uniqueness.
        </p>
        <h2>Sustainable</h2>
        <p>
          We make every strive to be sustainable through each step of the process. All of the clothes are made of second-hand or donated clothes, as
          well as leftover fabric scraps from factories. This is in effort to keep clothes out of the landfill. We also ship the clothes to you in
          recycled/recyclable packaging to decrease the overall carbon footprint. We believe in sustainable fashion to build a better (and more
          fashionable) future.
        </p>
        <h2>Inclusive</h2>
        <p>
          Here at Daydreamer we strive to be as inclusive as possible because everyone deserves to express themselves. We have sizes ranging from XS
          to XXL and if you ever need a bigger or smaller size, please reach out and let us know and we will do what we can. We also try to be as
          gender neutral as possible, because after all, clothes are just clothes. This can lead to some size discrepancies but we provide a size
          chart to help you find what size will fit you best.
        </p>
        <h2>Daydreamer Raw Promise</h2>
        <p>
          The Daydreamer Raw Promise is a promise that each of the pictures of the products/models are free of photoshop. There are only slight
          lighting fixes in order to make the picture match what the product will look like when you order it. We want to showcase natural bodies and
          that everyone is worthy of loving themselves.
